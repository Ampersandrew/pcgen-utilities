=head1 NAME

   Pretty::Logger - a logging package for Lst file processing

=head1 VERSION

   1.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

   This package is used extensively for the reporting of warnings, errors, etc.
   while procdessing a set of Lst files. It is functions largely through the 
   use of the perl warn command.

   This package is based in a large part on the former Ewarn package.
   Ewarn was a start on seperating the functions of PrettyLst into
   packages with different concerns.

=cut

=head2 set_header

   Set the header for the error message.

   This also ensures the header is displayed on the first log call after
   setting this value.

=cut

sub set_header
{
   my ($self, $h) = @_;

   # Add a line feed before the header to separate it from the previous
   # content, unless we are at the very start of the log.
   my $header = $self->isStartOfLog() ? $h : "\n${h}";

   $self->header($header);
   $self->isFirstError(1);

   # We blank the previous file name to make sure that the file name will be
   # printed with the first message after the header.
   $self->fileNamePrevious('');
}
